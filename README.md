This is helper for filling PASRS.
Currently it is not working. It will be working very soon.

Currently it only triggers the /savereplay command and then saves it to the clipboard. It is planned to be able to fill the PASRS form automatically.

I'm hustling with the chrome extension controls now.
Next stop is adding a tab like room tab or showdex to move the controls there.(It might have been easier to do that. I'm not sure. I'm learning as I go.)
Nexter stop is adding google sheet support to save the replays there automagicly. But i might be lazy to do that. I'm not sure. Clipboard speeds up the process a lot.
