This is very early Keyboard Controller for Pokemon Showdown. I designed it to use it while taking notes on my right hand. It is not very good, but it works.

This is very early Alpha, so there are many bugs. Please report them in the issues tab.

If you can fix some of the bugs, please make a pull request.

## Features
F1: Toggle Keyboard Control
1-4: Select Moves.
X: Toggle Switch Mode.
1-6: Switch Pokemon (in Switch Mode).
Z: Tera
C: Cancel
A: Close and Main Menu
D: Bo3 Continute Button

##Â Future Goals.
* Overload Focus Room function to add highligthing and toggling switch mode automatically
* Implement and arrow keys version for more "in cart" feeling.
* Less jank code.
* Settings page for selecting default mode etc.
