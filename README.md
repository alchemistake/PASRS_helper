Helper extension for PASRS & [Pokemon Showdown](https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/) that automatically uploads the replay of your last battle in PSD then it will be copied to your clipboard.
Currently it only triggers the /savereplay command and then saves it to the clipboard.

Room generation code comes from [Showdex](https://github.com/doshidak/showdex).

Future plans include adding Google Sheet support to log the replays there automagicly.
